= BUGS/PROBLEMS/FEATURE REQUESTS

 * delete verification message from group after user has verified
 * remove walletconnect debug logging
 * jonathan: after verification, it would be nice if it showed me what NFT it found.
 * add bcmr lookup for nicer messaging (use token name instead of category id in user-facing messages)
 * add "user verified" message to the group, maybe with an nft pic?
 * consider a /list_verifications command, maybe at in the bot chat rather than the group?
 * remove_category should accept category names (symbol? or whatever we display) instead of only the long hex id
 
 
= IMPLEMENTED, BUT PENDING TEST

	* jonathan was able to write to group and the write was not followed by the bot checking verification
